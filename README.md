# MNIST Examples

MNIST is the standard "Hello World" of deep learning. These are examples using [DJL](https://djl.ai/) (Deep Java Library) and [DL4J](https://deeplearning4j.org/) (Deeplearning4j). That are simply to demonstrate some very, very basic examples in a talk I gave for Sngular on October 22, 2020. I'm a noob at deep learning so these follow very closely with the examples in the various libraries. I've added sample MNIST data from one or more frameworks that were OpenSourced. Feel free to unzip to play around with sample data.

## Running
